# Bike Sharing Data Visualization

## Overview

The project uses data from the NYC Citi Bike Share program. The purpose of the analysis is to determine the viability of implementing a similar program in Des Moines, Iowa. Visualizations of the business prospects allow for a more in-depth understanding of the NYC Citi Bike Share program to assist in a possible business pitch to investors.

###  Visualizations

This visualization shows the most common start locations for bikes used in the bikesharing program. Larger circles in dense areas denote a more popular location by users.

This visualization similarly to the previous, shows the most common end locations for bikes used in the bikesharing program.

This visualization graphs the elapsed time for trips by all users. Shorter trips are more popular with the peak trip time being 5 minutes.

This visualization similarly graphs the elapsed time for trips broken down by the gender of the users. Across all genders short trips around 5 minutes is most common.

This visualization uses a heatmap to display the distribution of trips during a week by the hour. The darker blocks indicate a time slot where more trips are taken during that time. Weekday mornings at approximately 8am are a popular time for morning commutes by bike. During the evenings on Monday, Tuesday, and Thursday the most bikes are used between 5pm - 7 pm.

This visualization breaksdown the heatmap by gender. The mornings around 8am, Monday thru Friday, is the highest use time for both females and males. Similarly, bikes are rented more heavily in the evenings during the week between 5 pm and 7pm. The visualization for "UNKNOWN" is not diagnostic, possibly from users where the gender was left unmarked or preferred not to answer.

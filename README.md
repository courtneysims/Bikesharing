# Bike Sharing Data Visualization

## Overview

The project uses data from the NYC Citi Bike Share program. The purpose of the analysis is to determine the viability of implementing a similar program in Des Moines, Iowa. Visualizations of the business prospects allow for a more in-depth understanding of the NYC Citi Bike Share program to assist in a possible business pitch to investors.

This visualization shows the most common start locations for bikes used in the bikesharing program. Larger circles in dense areas denote a more popular location by users.

This visualization, similarly to the previous, shows the most common end locations for bikes used in the bikesharing program. The more popular locations by users is displayed by larger circles; the dense clustering shown indicates the peninsula is a popular area.

The graph displays the elapsed time for trips by all users. Shorter trips are more popular with the peak trip time being 5 minutes.

This visualization similarly graphs the elapsed time for trips broken down by the gender of the users. Across all genders short trips around 5 minutes is most common.

The visualization uses a heatmap to display the distribution of trips during a week by the hour. As the number of trips recorded for that hour increase, the instensity of the color darkens. The darker blocks indicate a time slot where more trips are taken during that time. Weekday mornings at approximately 8am are a popular time for morning commutes by bike. During the evenings on Monday, Tuesday, and Thursday the most bikes are used between 5pm - 7 pm. Notable, Wednesday appears to show a lower number of bike trips possibly indicating a slower day in the week. The weekends appear to have more trips during the midday hours (10 am - 6pm).

This visualization breaksdown the heatmap for bike trips by gender. The mornings around 8am, Monday thru Friday, is the highest use time for both females and males. Similarly, bikes are rented more heavily in the evenings during the week between 5 pm and 7pm. The visualization for "UNKNOWN" is relatively lacking in details, possibly from users where the gender was not specified or preferred not to answer.

The heatmap generated for this visualization shows the type of users checking out bikes in the bike share program. The customer usertype are customers who do not regularly use the bike share system, paying for each trip. The subscriber usertype are those that have paid a subscription to the system to frequently use the system. The data shows that the majority of users are subscribers.

## Summary

The results of the data show that a bike share program is successful in NYC.
